Education_Management_System : 
The Education Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the administration, management, and interaction within educational institutions. This project provides a platform for students, teachers, and administrators to manage courses, records, and communications efficiently.
In this project new usersâ€”whether teachers or students can create their own profiles by registering. However, they can access their profiles and login only after the admin grants them the necessary permissions. This ensures controlled accessibility and a secure user management system.
